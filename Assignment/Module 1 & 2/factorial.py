# Q. Write a Python program to get the Factorial number of given number. 


number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
elif number == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1.")
else:
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        factorial *= i

    print("The factorial of", number, "is", factorial)
