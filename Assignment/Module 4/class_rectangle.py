# Q. Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle 

class Rectangle:

    def __init__(self,length,width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def compute_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width


rectangle = Rectangle(4,5)


area = rectangle.compute_area()
print("Area of the rectangle:", area)
